        My enthusiasm for coding stems from a deep seated desire to create.
        There is something wonderful about making something well made and
        useful, every line clicking together like clockwork. Seeing something
        emerge from nothing but a concept like that is what still makes me so
        excited for every new project.

        My ethos towards code is to make it with thought for the future and the
        next programmer. I write code that'll last for the next 10 years, and
        when it fails I want the next programmer to be able to understand it at
        a glance and to be able to fix it in a few lines. Code like that
        requires skills to write, but I was very lucky to be taught by a senior
        programmer with the same ethos who also taught me to be efficient and
        fast so we could still meet deadlines.

        I began my career as a frontend developer working in React. My skills
        developed as I progressed, and I was given opportunities to design and
        build apps for my company. Later I was also trained to work on the
        backend using C# and Azure to expand and maintain the database behind
        the apps. Later, I was given the opportunity to build a full online shop
        as a freelancer, which I completed using React and Firestore.
