            text={
              'I created this game out of a desire to explore more of the Pico8 game engine. As the Pico8 game engine gives no built-in physics, building even a basic game requires a lot of fundamental skills that are skipped over in engines such as Unity. The challenges I expected to face in this project were the creation of things such as gravity and linear movement in a realistic way. I thought this project would showcase an understanding of physics in game making, and working in a limited environment.'

          text={
            "The ocean, covering over 70% of the Earth's surface, remains one of the most mysterious and unexplored places on our planet. Despite advances in technology, vast areas of the deep sea are still uncharted, harboring ecosystems that challenge our understanding of life itself. From the sunlit coral reefs teeming with vibrant marine life to the pitch-dark trenches where life forms appear almost alien, the ocean is a realm of wonders. Scientific expeditions continuously uncover new species and geological formations, revealing the ocean's role in regulating the Earth's climate and supporting biodiversity. Human activities, such as overfishing and pollution, threaten these fragile ecosystems, emphasizing the urgent need for conservation efforts. Exploring and protecting the ocean is not only a scientific endeavor but a crucial step toward sustaining the health of our planet for future generations."

            'Forests are often described as the lungs of the Earth, providing oxygen, absorbing carbon dioxide, and hosting countless species of plants and animals. Yet, beyond their environmental importance lies a quieter, more subtle role in human culture and well-being. Silent forests offer a refuge from the noise of urban life, a place where the mind can rest and reconnect with nature. The sounds of rustling leaves, birdsong, and flowing streams foster a sense of peace and grounding. Despite their silence, these environments teem with life, communicating through intricate networks underground and above, demonstrating how even quiet spaces are full of vibrant activity. Protecting forests means preserving biodiversity, climate stability, and our mental health, all of which are under threat from deforestation and climate change.'
